# README.md - tests/test_input

This directory contains input data for running the `pdp` test suites.

Data is kept in subdirectories corresponding to the tests for which it is used:

- `pdp_config`: contains configuration files used to test the `pdp config` subcommand
- `pdp_filter`: contains configuration files used to test the `pdp filter` subcommand
- `sequences`: contains input bacterial genome sequences; stitched and ambiguity symbol-corrected sequences are placed here as the tests are run
