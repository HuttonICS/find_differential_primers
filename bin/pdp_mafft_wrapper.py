"""pdp_mafft_wrapper.py

This script is a wrapper for the MAFFT alignment package.
It is required in order to catch STDOUT ahead of the SGE job
runner so that pdp can run on SGE/OGE scheduling systems.

The wrapper does not modify the output of MAFFT, and
is called in exactly the same way, passing arguments through
directly. The only departure from this is that the first
argument is the path to MAFFT, and the final
argument denotes the path to MAFFT output, so that
redirection (which no longer works with SGE/OGE) is not
necessary.

For example, the MAFFT command

mafft [options] <FASTA file> > <ALN file>

becomes

pdp_mafft_wrapper.py <path to MAFFT> [options] <FASTA file> <ALN file>

This wrapper is not very robust, but will be improved in later
versions of pdp.
